This project is about Dental Cleaning Teeth Detection, the dataset that we have is from a different source which is from:
•	Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wvVrkMKim8
•	Capture using webcam 
•	Capture using phone
The three sources above is a video source then, we extract it by frame using OpenCV Python. We already separate the file in train, test. The train and test folder consist of images and an annotation label using LabelImg to annotate the images.
