A project has been carried out with relation to the dental students, deep learning, and augmented reality (AR) to identify the challenges that dental students face and provide a new type of learning based on the observation. Based on various articles, it shows that most studies stated that COVID-19 has cause major disruptions on the educational institutions in forcing the student to adapt to online learning and cancellation of overall physical assessment. Thus, the result of this project identified that Dental students still could proceed with their education virtually / online. This project focus on deep learning based on AR for dental education in which students could practicing their bits of knowledge by using an AR application where they can identify several types of teeth in real-time. Hence, this project might be a great option for them to nurture their skills and strengthen their experiences without having face-to-face practicals. The dataset that we have is from a different source which is from:

•	Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wvVrkMKim8

•	Capture using webcam 

•	Capture using phone

source code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hK2TPI8AMZZDzNSIrFqqoT1XVuyRxIi5?usp=sharing

The three sources above is a video source then, we extract it by frame using OpenCV Python. We already separate the file in train, test. The train and test folder consist of images and an annotation label using LabelImg to annotate the images.
